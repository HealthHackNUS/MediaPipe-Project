# Welcome to MoveSync :smile:

## Introduction 
Movesync is a pilot project developed for a hackathon, serving as a proof of concept for remote rehabilitation technology. This cutting-edge device leverages advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence to aid patients in their physiotherapy and rehabilitation journey from the comfort of their homes.

### Key features of MoveSync include:
1. Real-time exercise form detection
2. Personalized progress tracking
3. AI-driven exercise recommendations

Movesync aims to bridge the gap between in-person physiotherapy sessions and at-home exercises. This pilot project demonstrates the potential for accessible, efficient, and effective remote rehabilitation solutions, paving the way for improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
